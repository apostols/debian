Motion for Debian
-----------------

Motion supports Debian's ffmpeg, but currently it encodes in SWF by
default since the latest versions of ffmpeg stripped support for mpeg1,
mpeg4, and msmpeg4 due to patents.

You can see more in: http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/f/ffmpeg/current/changelog

Enjoy :)
